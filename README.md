# Portfolio of Cameron Afzal
As a product engineer at Optimatics I develop software for water infrastructure optimization and decision support and work with clients on expanding the features and applications of our platform. We collaborate on the interface of software and systems engineering. My career goal is to harness emerging applications of artificial intelligence to manage complex systems under uncertainty. I aim to tackle the gray area of decision making through my diverse background which includes philosophy and computer science skills.
